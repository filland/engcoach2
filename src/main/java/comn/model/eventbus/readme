This package implements classes that
allows controllers exchange events between each other

EvenBus works on the base of the Observer pattern

Example:
a button 'show transcription' was clicked. The click is handled in the TopMenuController
in the showTranscrClicked method. There is one line in that method that
register an event in EventBus then code of each event handler that was added to the eventBus
is executed. Almost always these event handlers are in other controllers.
